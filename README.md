## Project Structure

### Backend
The backend is built using Node.js and Express. It handles API requests, manages user submissions, and interacts with the Azure SQL database.

#### Key Files:
- `server.js`: The entry point of the backend server.
- `routes/`: Contains route files for handling API requests (competitions, threads, comments, etc.).
- `db/`: Contains database connection setup (connection pools).
- `Controllers/`: Used to control queries for specific data models.
- `Models/`: Interact directly with the Azure SQL server for data in the tables.

### Frontend
The frontend is built using React, and it communicates with the backend API to display threads, competitions, and user-submitted competition entries.

#### Key Files:
- `src/App.js`: The main React component, rendering the entire app interface.
- `src/components/`: Contains React components used across the app (e.g., forms, thread listings).
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions to handle API requests.
- `src/pages/`: Sections of the site that display data and allow user interaction.

### Hosting Platform
We host our backend and frontend on Render. The frontend uses the static site option, and the backend uses the web service option.
